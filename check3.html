            <img src="img5.jpg">
            <p>I’m going to be honest. For the past week, I’ve been racking my brain trying to think of a fun, 
                original 4th of July article for this year's festivities -- but I've drawn a blank. Festivals and holidays are marketing gold,
                 but as effective at driving sales and “delighting” customers as they are, thinking of a campaign that is both unique and 
                 memorable isn’t easy. </p>

            <p>You know what I used to hate growing up? Summer Reading. Picking up a book just for fun was and is great, 
                but like most good things, once we were forced to do it, it lost all its charm. I have to admit though, 
                despite the annoyance and intrusion on our summer relaxation, our teachers had good reason to assign what they did. 
                We learned a lot (maybe with a little help from Sparknotes) and sometimes they were even genuinely fun to read. 
                So, listen up, class... </p>

            <p>User Experience is one of my favorite things to talk about -- if that weren’t obvious enough to those of you 
                who have seen me and Jessie-Lee Nichols tear apart the user-submitted websites during IMPACTs Website Throwdown!
                 Nothing excites me more than taking a deep dive into the usability and functionality of a website and, 
                 with a background in graphic and web design and years of experience as an inbound marketer, 
                 I have become quite good at understanding UX and its importance in creating a successful marketing strategy.</p>

            <p>If working in the agency world has taught me anything, its that you are going to be presented with some pretty challenging
                 problems and you need to face them head-on. But finding the solution to those problems isn't always the easiest, 
                 and it can feel pretty aggravating when you just can't solve them. </p>

            <p>I’ve always considered myself a generally happy person and, pun not intended, I’m glad. We talk about this at IMPACT quite a bit;
                ow a person’s mood can really affect the team around them and we take it very seriously. If there’s something bothering you 
                that’s work-related, talk to the proper person. If it’s personal, work from home or take some time off.  Even with this culture,
                 I never considered the fact that you can actually measure someone’s overall happiness. </p>
